Color Scheme helper

This just highlights the highlighting groups of the color scheme you are
editing in the current buffer -- so that you can see what you are doing.

:CShelper   - Do 'color g:colors_name' of the file in the buffer, then do CShelperHL

:CShelperHL - update highlight from current buffer
